# Introduction

## The problem

- Lot of decentralized groups : the community is scattered and very diverse from core developers to artist and gamers
- No single entrypoint : There are plenty of tools, social networks and user registries
- No effective information broadcast to all members : lot of scams, spams, bots or trollers
- No global company/member directory : each application reimplements its own user registry bringing either duplication or separated worlds

We are not going to tackle the problem of the unique identity like [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/), instead we concentrate our effort on the **pseudonymity** already provided by **Tezos addresses** combined with **grouping** feature and restricted **social media linking**

- **Identity** :
  1. strictly pseudonymous Tezos addresses
  2. (optional) restricted display name, alias and picture from different social networks available for people from same organization
- **Organizations** : a way to regroup people inside a cluster
- **Internal alerting system** : a non gas-free way to send important message to other clusters and get alerted on real time

## Final goal

This application :

- should not be seen as a final product but as a **base layer for other application to integrate with**. Example : providing a list of player for a mobile game where it is hard to type and remember a tz1 address
- does not require high presence. It has to be seen **as a configuration tool** like a contact list, a LDAP or other user registries running in background
